# Brute-Force-V2
This is an improved version of the Brute-Force-V1 program I made. This time I used recursion to replace the for loops I had in the previous program. Now there is no character limit that the password can be and the program takes less attempts.

ABOUT THE PROGRAM:
- Find passwords of any length;
- Takes fewer attempts than the last program;
- You can choose the length of the password you want to start with.

CHANGING THE LENGTH OF THE PASSWORD THAT THE PROGRAM WILL START TESTING:
- Go to the length variable and change its value.
   EXAMPLE:
  - If you want to start cracking 8-character passwords, change the "length" value to 7;
  - If you want to start cracking 12-character passwords, change the "length" value to 11;
  (Always put one less than the number you want).

IMPORTANT:
- Use .NET 7.0;
- I don't recommend running this code in online compilers, as they are extremely slow (compile on your machine);
- I recommend using Visual Studio;
- Don't run this program in your IDE's terminal (unless you're using Visual Studio, because it already opens the .exe file directly), look for the .exe file that was generated (after compiling) and run it.

- Uncomment line 40 to see the combinations beeing generated. I don't recommend doing this as it delays the process a LOT.
